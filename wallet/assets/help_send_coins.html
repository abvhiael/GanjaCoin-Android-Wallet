			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a GanjaCoin URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the GanjaCoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with GanjaCoin addresses or GanjaCoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many GanjaCoins you have available to spend at the moment.
			Any difference between the balance from the main screen and this balance is due to still unconfirmed transactions and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of GanjaCoin Wallet.
			If you want a payment to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN).

		<p>
			Note:
			Payments are irreversible!
			Always check the receiving address.
